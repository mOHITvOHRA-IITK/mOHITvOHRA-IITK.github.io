Machine Vision, GNSS-deprived localization (SLAM), autonomous inspection, sensor-robot integration, point cloud processing, and GNSS/RTK-based localization.

<p>
I work on developing advanced robotic systems for various autonomous applications, with a primary focus on designing perception systems that enable robots to understand their environment and target objects. 
These systems integrate data such as images and point clouds, from multiple sensors, and use machine learning approaches to extract meaningful information for accurate perception. 
The robotic systems I design include **highly functional prototypes developed in the lab and validated under controlled and field-like conditions**, demonstrating capabilities such as novel object grasping for warehouse automation, brick sorting for construction automation, human-mimic robotic systems for object sorting, automatic underground cable tracing, and teleoperated systems for overhead line insulator cleaning.
